Welcome to John's VirtualEnv and Tools Setup extravaganza! 

I've put together a package of tools and folder structure to make python development a little easier. 

To set up everything you'll need to:

1. Copy the "Skeleton Template" and rename it to your_file_name_here
2. open a cmd window and cd into your copy. You'll need to be at this level for everything else
	--IE: cd c:\john\your_file_name_here
3. run the command: virtualenv venv
	--Technically "venv" can be any name you want. I use it for simplicity.
	--This creates a complete copy of the python environment residing on the server. You can now modify it, pip install items, etc. without harming 
	the original installation
4. install the requirements.txt with this line:
	venv\scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
5. You're done! you're now able to execute the run.py file with a command like:
	venv\scripts\python run.py
6. There's also a bat file example you can modify so you can schedule a task with the windows scheduler
